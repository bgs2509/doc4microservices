## Service Types and Event Loop Separation

### Critical Architecture Constraints

## Implementation Guidelines

### Cursor Rules (Mandatory Study)

This technology stack must be implemented according to detailed guides in docs root categories (architecture/, services/, infrastructure/, observability/, quality/). These rules contain specific patterns, requirements and code examples.

#### Core Architecture Rules
- **`../architecture/ms_best_practices_rules.mdc`** - Main guide for microservice architecture, DDD/Hex patterns, project structure and quality requirements
- **`../quality/testing-standards.mdc`** - Testing standards with mandatory 100% coverage for critical paths

#### Service Type Rules
- **`../services/fastapi_rules.mdc`** - Detailed rules for HTTP API services on FastAPI
- **`../services/aiogram_rules.mdc`** - Standards for Telegram Bot services on Aiogram
- **`../services/asyncio_rules.mdc`** - Rules for Background Worker services on AsyncIO

#### Infrastructure Rules
- **`../observability/logging_rules.mdc`** - Unified logging standard with Request ID tracing
- **`../infrastructure/redis_rules.mdc`** - Redis patterns for caching and idempotency
- **`../infrastructure/rabbitmq_rules.mdc`** - RabbitMQ standards for inter-service communication

### Critical Implementation Principles

#### 1. Event Loop Separation
- Each service type (FastAPI, Aiogram, AsyncIO) MUST run in separate process
- PROHIBITED to mix FastAPI and Aiogram in same process
- Use RabbitMQ for communication between service types

#### 2. Dependency Injection Patterns
- **FastAPI**: `app.state.redis`, `app.state.rabbitmq` + dependency injection
- **Aiogram**: `dp.startup.register()` + dependency injection in handlers
- **AsyncIO**: global clients in `main()` + pass as arguments

#### 3. Tracing and Idempotency
- Request ID MUST be generated and passed through all services
- Redis MUST be used for idempotency checking
- All operations MUST be idempotent

#### 4. Testing
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- Use testcontainers for integration tests
- Real databases instead of mocks in integration tests

**Next Steps**: Implement business logic in services according to docs rule patterns (architecture/, services/, infrastructure/, observability/, quality/).

### Docker Compose Organization

#### RECOMMENDED: Single Root Compose File
- **Primary file**: `docker-compose.yml` in project root
- **Development overrides**: `docker-compose.override.yml` (auto-loaded)
- **Production config**: `docker-compose.prod.yml` (explicit)

#### Benefits of Root-Level Compose:
- **Shared Infrastructure**: All services share Redis, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, and observability stack
- **Inter-service Communication**: Proper Docker networks between services and monitoring
- **Dependency Management**: Correct startup order (infrastructure â†’ observability â†’ services)
- **Environment Consistency**: Unified environment variables and secrets
- **Simplified Development**: Single `docker-compose up` starts entire stack including monitoring

#### Deployment Commands:
See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#development-commands) for complete command reference including development, production, and observability operations.

### Compliance Verification

All implementations MUST comply with cursor rules. For verification:

1. Study relevant `../*/*.mdc` files
2. Follow code examples from rules
3. Use verification commands from each rule
4. Achieve 100% test coverage for critical paths

**IMPORTANT**: Cursor rules are the source of truth for implementation. In case of conflicts between tech_stack.md and cursor rules, cursor rules take priority.
