# Legacy Documentation Archive

This directory hosts the original `.mdc` source materials preserved for historical reference. Each file retains its original name so that existing references remain valid. New documentation must live in the `docs/atomic` tree, and any updates to legacy content should be recorded as migration notes rather than modifying these archived files.
