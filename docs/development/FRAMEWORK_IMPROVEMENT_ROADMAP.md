# Framework Improvement Roadmap

> **STATUS**: Analysis-based roadmap for framework documentation and feature enhancements
>
> **PURPOSE**: This document outlines critical gaps in framework documentation discovered through AI generation workflow analysis of 35 business ideas
>
> **METHODOLOGY**: Analysis conducted by examining AI code generation patterns and identifying recurring documentation gaps that lead to implementation problems

## Executive Summary

Through analysis of 35 diverse business application scenarios, we identified systematic documentation gaps that affect AI code generation quality and developer productivity. These gaps fall into 5 main categories and can be addressed through 12 priority improvement areas.

## ðŸ”¥ Critical Documentation Gaps

### 1. Authentication & Security
Current framework lacks essential security implementation guidance:
- **Missing**: JWT authentication patterns with FastAPI integration
- **Missing**: Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation examples
- **Missing**: Data encryption at rest and in transit examples
- **Missing**: Secure credential management patterns

**Impact**: 80% of business applications require authentication, leading to inconsistent security implementations.

### 2. External API Integration
Framework documentation doesn't cover third-party service integration:
- **Missing**: Payment gateway integration patterns (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- **Missing**: Communication service integration (SMS, email providers)
- **Missing**: Webhook handling patterns for external services
- **Missing**: API rate limiting and retry mechanisms

**Impact**: Most business applications require external integrations, causing implementation delays.

### 3. File Storage & Media Processing
No guidance for file handling in microservices architecture:
- **Missing**: File upload/download patterns across services
- **Missing**: Media processing workflows in AsyncIO workers
- **Missing**: Cloud storage integration (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- **Missing**: Image/video processing examples

**Impact**: Applications requiring file handling lack proper architecture guidance.

### 4. Advanced PostgreSQL Patterns
Current PostgreSQL documentation covers only basic use cases:
- **Missing**: Complex relational model examples
- **Missing**: Database indexing strategies for performance
- **Missing**: Production migration patterns and rollback procedures
- **Missing**: Multi-tenant database architecture patterns

**Impact**: Complex business applications hit PostgreSQL implementation barriers.

### 5. Real-time Communication Features
Framework lacks real-time communication implementation guidance:
- **Missing**: WebSocket integration patterns with FastAPI
- **Missing**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation examples
- **Missing**: Push notification systems architecture
- **Missing**: Real-time data synchronization patterns

**Impact**: Modern applications requiring real-time features lack implementation guidance.
