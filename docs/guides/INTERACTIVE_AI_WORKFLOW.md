## Phase 1: Business Idea Input

### What Developer Provides

```
Example Input:
"I want to build a P2P lending platform where users can:
- Lend money to each other
- Create loan requests
- Make payments with automatic interest calculation
- Track credit scores
- Get notifications via Telegram bot
"
```

**Optional additions:**
- Technology preferences
- Scale expectations (users, transactions/day)
- Special requirements (compliance, security, integrations)
- Timeline constraints

### What AI Must Do: VALIDATION & CLARIFICATION

#### Step 1.1: Load Framework Context
AI reads:
- `.framework/docs/LINKS_REFERENCE.md#core-documentation` ‚Üí Architecture constraints
- `.framework/docs/guides/PROMPT_VALIDATION_GUIDE.md` ‚Üí Validation checklist
- `.framework/docs/reference/AGENT_CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md` ‚Üí Quick reference

#### Step 1.2: Validate Against Architecture
AI checks:
```python
# AI internal validation
‚úì Does idea fit Improved Hybrid Approach? (Yes/No)
‚úì Can it use PostgreSQL + MongoDB? (Yes/No)
‚úì Does it need FastAPI service? (Yes/No)
‚úì Does it need Telegram bot? (Yes/No)
‚úì Does it need background workers? (Yes/No)
‚úì Are there architectural conflicts? (List or None)
```

#### Step 1.3: Identify Missing Information
AI creates a checklist:
```markdown
Missing Information Needed:
‚ñ° User authentication method (OAuth, JWT, magic link)?
‚ñ° Payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, crypto)?
‚ñ° Expected scale (100 users, 10K users, 1M users)?
‚ñ° Compliance requirements (KYC, AML, GDPR)?
‚ñ° Notification channels (Telegram only, or email/SMS too)?
‚ñ° Data retention period (30 days, 1 year, forever)?
```

### AI Response Format

## üîç Understanding Your P2P Lending Platform

I've analyzed your business idea against the microservices framework architecture.

### ‚úÖ Feasibility: CONFIRMED
Your P2P lending platform is an excellent fit for the Improved Hybrid Approach.

### üèóÔ∏è Preliminary Architecture Mapping:

**Core Services Needed:**
- ‚úÖ **FastAPI Service** (Port 8000) - REST API for web/mobile clients
- ‚úÖ **Telegram Bot Service** - User notifications and interactions
- ‚úÖ **Worker Service** - Interest calculation, payment processing, credit scoring
- ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL Data Service** (Port 8001) - Users, loans, payments, transactions
- ‚úÖ **MongoDB Data Service** (Port 8002) - User activity logs, audit trail, analytics

**Infrastructure:**
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL - Transactional data (ACID compliance)
- ‚úÖ MongoDB - Analytics and audit logs
- ‚úÖ Redis - Session management, rate limiting, cache
- ‚úÖ RabbitMQ - Event-driven workflows (loan.created, payment.processed)

### ‚ùì Questions to Clarify:

Before I create the implementation plan, I need to clarify:

**1. Authentication & Security:**
   - How should users authenticate? (JWT tokens, OAuth2, magic links?)
   - Do you need two-factor authentication (2FA)?
   - KYC/AML compliance requirements?

**2. Payment Processing:**
   - Which payment gateway? (Stripe, PayPal, bank transfer, cryptocurrency?)
   - Automatic payment scheduling or manual?
   - Escrow service needed?

**3. Scale & Performance:**
   - Expected number of users in first year? (100, 1K, 10K, 100K?)
   - Expected daily transactions? (10, 100, 1K?)
   - Geographic regions? (single country, worldwide?)

**4. Notifications:**
   - Telegram only, or also email/SMS?
   - Notification frequency preferences?

**5. Regulatory & Compliance:**
   - Which country/region regulations apply?
   - Data retention requirements?
   - GDPR compliance needed?

**6. Credit Scoring:**
   - Use external credit score API or build internal algorithm?
   - What factors determine creditworthiness?

**7. Additional Features:**
   - Loan marketplace (users browse available loans)?
   - Automated matching (system suggests loans to lenders)?
   - Secondary market (sell loan contracts)?
   - Social features (borrower profiles, reviews)?

### üìù Please Answer:

You can answer in any format. For example:

```
1. JWT tokens, yes to 2FA, basic KYC (ID verification)
2. Stripe for payments, automatic scheduling, yes to escrow
3. Target 1K users first year, ~50 transactions/day, EU only
4. Telegram + email, daily digest for lenders, instant for critical events
5. EU regulations, 7 years data retention, yes GDPR
6. Internal algorithm based on: repayment history, loan amount, duration
7. Yes to marketplace, maybe automated matching later, no secondary market yet
```

Or just describe in your own words - I'll extract the details.
````

## Phase 2: Requirements Capture

### What Developer Provides

```
Example Response:
"1. JWT with 2FA via SMS, basic KYC (government ID scan)
2. Stripe, automatic monthly payments, escrow held by platform
3. Start with 1K users, 50 loans/day, EU + UK
4. Telegram for instant alerts, email for daily summaries
5. EU GDPR + FCA regulations (UK), 7-year retention
6. Internal scoring: payment history (50%), loan/income ratio (30%), account age (20%)
7. Yes marketplace, automated matching in v2, no secondary market"
```

## üéØ Summary: Interactive AI Workflow

### Key Principles:

1. **AI Never Assumes** - Always asks for clarification
2. **Phased Approach** - Developer approves each phase
3. **Transparent** - AI shows what it's doing in real-time
4. **Iterative** - Developer can request changes anytime
5. **Educational** - AI explains architectural decisions
6. **Framework-Aligned** - Every decision references `.framework/docs/`

### Communication Pattern:

```
Developer: Business idea
AI: Validation + Questions

Developer: Answers
AI: Requirements document

Developer: Approve/Adjust
AI: Implementation plan

Developer: Approve/Adjust
AI: Generate code (phase-by-phase)

Developer: Review + Changes
AI: Update + Re-test

Developer: Deploy
AI: Verification + Handoff
```

### Time Distribution:

- üìù Planning (10%): Clarification, requirements, architecture
- üíª Coding (70%): Systematic code generation phase-by-phase
- üîÑ Iteration (15%): Developer feedback, adjustments
- ‚úÖ Verification (5%): Testing, deployment, handoff

---

**This workflow ensures:**
- Zero wasted effort (plan approved before coding)
- Zero architectural drift (framework enforces patterns)
- Zero missing requirements (comprehensive clarification upfront)
- Maximum developer control (approve each phase)
