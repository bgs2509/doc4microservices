# Atomic Documentation Hub

The `docs/atomic` tree provides the canonical, domain-scoped knowledge base for the platform. Each Markdown file focuses on a single responsibility and serves as the definitive reference for its topic. Authors should keep documents concise, link to source code or diagrams when relevant, and record any legacy context inside migration notes rather than here.
