## Security Best Practices for Users

When using this framework in production:

### 1. Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use strong, unique passwords for all services
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use secrets management solutions in production (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

### 2. Network Security
- Always use TLS/SSL in production
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Use VPN or private networks for internal services
- Enable rate limiting on all public APIs

### 3. Container Security
- Keep base images updated
- Scan images for vulnerabilities regularly
- Don't run containers as root
- Use read-only filesystems where possible

### 4. Database Security
- Enable encryption at rest
- Use encrypted connections
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular backups with encryption
- Never expose database ports publicly

### 5. API Security
- Implement proper authentication (OAuth2, JWT)
- Use API keys for service-to-service communication
- Enable CORS properly
- Validate all inputs
- Implement rate limiting

### 6. Monitoring & Logging
- Enable audit logging
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Set up alerts for security events
- Regular security audits
- Keep logs secure and encrypted
