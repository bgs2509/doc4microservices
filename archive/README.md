## Why These Files Are Archived

These working documents served their purpose during framework development:
- Analysis and insights have been integrated into main documentation
- Decisions documented in these reports are now reflected in the framework architecture
- Template naming issues identified in RENAME.md have been resolved
- Progress tracking in TEMPLATES_STATUS.md is superseded by actual template files

## Accessing Historical Information

If you need to understand the reasoning behind architectural decisions:
1. Check `docs/reference/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_LOG_TEMPLATE.md` for current ADRs
2. Review git commit history for detailed change rationale
3. Refer to main documentation in `docs/` for current best practices

These archived reports provide additional context but are not required for using the framework.
