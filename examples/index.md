This section contains comprehensive, production-ready code examples demonstrating the implementation of various service types and architectural patterns following the **"Improved Hybrid Approach"** architecture. All examples implement patterns from `docs/` *(or `.framework/docs/` when used as submodule)* rules and include:

- **RFC 7807 Error Handling**: Standardized problem details responses
- **Request Tracking**: Correlation ID and request ID middleware
- **Security Best Practices**: Proper password hashing, JWT authentication
- **Real Testing**: Testcontainers integration for database testing
- **Pagination & Filtering**: Complete data access patterns
- **Observability**: Structured logging and tracing integration

## Implementation Examples

Examples demonstrate the **Improved Hybrid Approach** with centralized data services and HTTP-only business logic communication.

> **ðŸ“– ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATION**: All examples follow the principles defined in the [Architecture Guide](../docs/LINKS_REFERENCE.md#core-documentation) and implement patterns from the [IDE Rules & Patterns](../docs/LINKS_REFERENCE.md#ide-rules-and-patterns).
